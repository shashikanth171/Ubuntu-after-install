# After-installing-Ubuntu
Install all the softwares you need at once

The idea is to have a simple way, for a user to select various softwares that he wants to install on a freshly installed ubuntu.

There are some existing softwares doing this job, but I wasn't able to find a way to contribute to it, i.e add softwares i use to the list.
for example: https://www.thefanclub.co.za/how-to/ubuntu-after-install

Present thought is to have a shell script file with steps of installing various softwares and users comment out or change variable values to install desired softwares.

Raise issues to ask me to add the softwares that you want, in the file.
